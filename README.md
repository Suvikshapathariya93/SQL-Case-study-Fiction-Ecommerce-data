## Introduction

This project features a fictional e-commerce logistics case study, demonstrating SQL queries to analyze and optimize warehouse operations, shipping efficiency, and supplier performance. The dataset represents a simplified logistics workflow with tables for warehouses, shipments, products, suppliers, and shipment details.

## Problem Statement
  
A fictional e-commerce company, SwiftLogix, specializes in logistics and order fulfillment. The company needs insights into warehouse operations, shipping efficiency, and supplier reliability to streamline processes and optimize costs.

The case study revolves around five key datasets:
  - Warehouses
  - Shipments
  - Products
  - Shipment Details
  - Suppliers

## Case Study: Questions and answers

**1. Total Shipments and Costs by Warehouse**
- Objective: Calculate the total shipments, weight, and cost managed by each warehouse
```sql
SELECT W.WarehouseID, W.WarehouseName, COUNT(S.ShipmentID) AS TotalShipments, SUM(S.TotalWeight) AS TotalWeight, SUM(S.TotalCost) AS TotalCost
FROM Warehouses W
LEFT JOIN Shipments S ON W.WarehouseID = S.WarehouseID
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC;
```
- **Tables**: `Warehouses` and `Shipments` are joined using `WarehouseID`.
- **Aggregation**:
  - `COUNT(S.ShipmentID)` calculates the total number of shipments for each warehouse.
  - `SUM(S.TotalWeight)` sums up the total weight of all shipments.
  - `SUM(S.TotalCost)` calculates the total cost of shipments.
- **Grouping**: The results are grouped by `WarehouseID` and `WarehouseName`.
- **Ordering**: The data is sorted in descending order of `TotalCost`.
